# My make of an interactive Sans Pivots and Payloads Game
Disclaimer: This is in no way supported or produced by Sans Institute. The board design belongs to them, the game 
rules belong to them, the game concept belongs to them. This is just me making it into a web game because I wanted to 
try it as a project.
## Why this as a project?
I was bored. I wanted to gain some JS, HTML, CSS experience. I hate doing boring things that normally are suggested 
as a project for beginners. So, I picked this. Other than that, no reason. 
## What's it do?
Well, right now there is a board. It pops up the content of a space if you click on it. There is a small "dice" game on 
a different route. Other than that? Nothing. Yet
## What's to come?
Eventually, I will make this into a multiplayer game, with moving pieces, following the rules of the actual game, with 
"game modifier" cards and everything. I also plan to make a pretty dice animation to simulate a die rolling across the
board. But all this will take time considering it is one of my first JS projects.
## How can I help?
As always, see CONTRIBUTIONS.md. This project is for me to learn, so I want most of the project to be done by me, but I
will accept PRs to features I have already done to improve code, as long as the PR explains what is better about the
way you did it (that is the only way I will learn instead of just copy pasting other people's code)
